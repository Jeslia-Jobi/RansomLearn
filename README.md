RamsomLearn is an interactive Ransomeware simulator devoloped for a college mini project. This software simulates the workings of a real life ransomware attack in a safe manner to educate others on the harm that
such malware pose. User's are able to enter an email to which a Ransomware is sent; on downloading, the script encrypts some files ( insensitive files) and they can be decrypted by only providing a secret code. 
If the code is not provided those files are deleted. They can be brought back by using a backup option.
Overall this project aims to showcase the working of a Ransomware, the way it is implemented, what happens after the ransomwre inflitrates the system and how the backup helps in protecting files.
