# RansomLearn

**RansomLearn** is a ransomware simulator designed to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats by mimicking a real ransomware attack scenario in a controlled environment.

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates how ransomware typically operates — from phishing delivery to encryption and ransom demands — helping users understand the importance of digital hygiene and maintaining backups.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Simulated Phishing Attack** – Sends a realistic-looking phishing email with a disguised executable download.
- **File Encryption** – Encrypts files in a predefined directory using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- **Ransom Note** – Displays a ransom note with a countdown and decryption passkey field.
- **Backup System** – Optional backup functionality to simulate the effectiveness of keeping secure file backups.
- **Decryption Logic** – Supports decryption of files upon providing the correct passkey before the countdown ends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages & UI:** Python, Dart, Flutter (UI)  
- **Backend & Database:** MongoDB  

## 🎯 Purpose

RansomLearn aims to simulate the lifecycle of a ransomware attack for educational purposes, helping users visualize the risks and learn safe computing practices. It also emphasizes the value of regular backups through its built-in recovery feature.
